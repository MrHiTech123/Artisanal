Hello!

First of all, thanks for contributing! It's really appreciated!

If you are contributing to the mod's datapack, please make sure that you 
are editing the Python-based datagen code (found in the Artisanal/resources folder),
NOT the datapack itself, as the files generated by the Python code will overwrite
any changes to the datapack when they're moved into the Artisanal/src/main/resources/ folder.
